### üè† Home
Attention has been paid to the distinction between Fragment & ViewModel.
Observe operations are done in the fragment.

```kotlin
private fun initializeDeals() {

        //Observer deals.
        homeViewModel.attractionsLiveData.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) {
            binding.dealsRecyclerview.adapter = HomeDealsAdapter(it)
        }

        //Observe loading.
        homeViewModel.loading.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) {
            if (it) {
                binding.dealsRecyclerview.visibility = View.GONE
                binding.dealsErrorText.visibility = View.GONE
                binding.dealsProgressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
            } else {
                binding.dealsRecyclerview.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                binding.dealsErrorText.visibility = View.GONE
                binding.dealsProgressBar.visibility = View.GONE
            }
        }

        //Observe error.
        homeViewModel.error.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) {
            if (it) {
                binding.dealsRecyclerview.visibility = View.GONE
                binding.dealsErrorText.visibility = View.VISIBLE
            } else {
                binding.dealsRecyclerview.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                binding.dealsErrorText.visibility = View.GONE
            }
        }
    }
```

### üîç Search
- Updates can be made by searching for `Region, Country, Venue, etc.` in this screen.
- When `Destinations` is scrolled, new items will start loading.
- `SearchView` will transfer `SearchResultFragment` when any text is written and the written text will be transferred there.

`Note:`Example function in view model.
```kotlin
fun addBookmark(
        attraction: Attraction,
        onBookmarkAddButtonClick: (Attraction) -> Unit
    ) {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            dbRepository.insert(attraction).collect() {
                when (it) {

                    is Resource.Loading -> {
                        loading.postValue(true)
                        error.postValue(false)
                    }

                    is Resource.Error -> {
                        loading.postValue(false)
                        error.postValue(true)
                    }

                    is Resource.Success -> {
                        loading.postValue(false)
                        error.postValue(false)
                        bookmarkList.add(attraction.id)
                        onBookmarkAddButtonClick(attraction)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
